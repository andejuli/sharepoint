    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Curriculum change can be a blessing for your students. It provides you with an opportunity to keep your program current, to trim fat, and to organize your courses in a way that will be meaningful and logical. </p>
    <p>However… </p>
    <p>You will find that students benefit from having a stable curriculum and that too many changes can hamper their ability to navigate your program.</p>
    <p>Curriculum change is probably the most complex knot you can get yourself tied up in, and it  creates short- and long-term impacts for yourself and for you students. </p>
    <img id="knot" src="knot.webp" alt="rope in a knot">
    <p>In this notebook, we have attempted to summarize information about curriculum change. While we have attempted to cover many topics, we know we have not covered every contingency and issue. Your Associate Dean of Curriculum, the Dean, individuals in SRR, and current and former chairs should be considered essential resources as you move forward with curriculum change. </p>
    <p>Involve SRR (Laurie Williams, williamsla@byui.edu) - If you have questions or if what you are doing seems complicated -- this is best done earlier rather than later.</p>
    <p>If you have questions that involve degree audits or iPlan, contact Parker Johnson in SRR.</p>

    <h2>Planning Change</h2>

    <button class="accordion">General Standards <span class='icon'>+</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Courses and Programs must have an Outcomes centric design. The syllabus or program justification must show how the outcomes are central and are incorporated into the course or program design. 
        </p>
        <p>Key assessments must be tied to each outcome and be common between sections. Each outcome should have a way of indicating how well it is being met. These assessments need to be sustainable and specific enough for improvements to be made in a periodic cycle. An assessment calendar must be included as part of the plan for programs. 
        </p>
        <p></p>No net new course or programs. New program may be approved if they are fully nested in existing program. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Program Specific Standards <span class='icon'>+</span> </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Programs should have a simple design. Emphasis areas and major electives should be minimized or eliminated so students can focus on key core concepts. Cross-disciplinary connections should be made to reduce duplication of classes and increase appropriate breadth in degrees.</p>
        <p>Programs are to take a holistic approach by tying all pieces of the degree together.
            It is preferred that substantive changes "come forward during program reviews instead of each year." The purpose for this is to ensure changes have been thoughtfully considered, advisory boards consulted, and to improve stability in curriculum for students.
            Nest or stack curriculum elements in ways that show deliberate design to bless the lives of all students.</p>
        <p>All courses included in a program proposal outside the sponsoring department need to show that the other department has been contacted and agrees with the class being included in or removed from the program.</p>
        <p>Development of programs and even courses should be done in consultation with those in industry who are most likely to hire our students and who understand what the students need. All programs should have an Advisory Council (good use of alumni) made-up of the experts who see where the job market is going
            keep program credits within the limit for the currently designated degree. [e.g., moving from a standard degree to an integrated standard degree will not be approved.] [Credit limits are in the attached “Curriculum Guidelines and Standards” document.]</p>
        <p>We cannot provide everything, so what we provide must be carefully considered. Programs that are offered should be scalable, meaning that serving more students it's accomplished by adding more sections and having online options for the right set of courses. In general, there will be no net new programs. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Course Specific Standards <span class='icon'>+</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <ol>
            <li>No net new courses - If new courses are proposed, a plan for meeting the needs of those new courses within existing resources must be provided. Our hope is at least a 1:1 ratio of new courses with courses being discontinued.</li>
            <li>Eliminate duplication of courses across departments - Departments work together to best meet the needs of students with the goal of minimizing or eliminating duplication. Follow contact hour guidelines - These are based on Department of Education definitions including credit hours awarded and type of contact - 1 credit of “lecture” allows 1 instructor/student contact hour per week. 1 credit of “lab or guided instruction” allows 1-3 instructor/student contact hours per week. Total student workload, including contact hours, should be around 3 hours per week per credit for all courses.</li>
            <li>If travel for a course requires students to spend time outside of regularly scheduled class times, it must be in the syllabus, be required of all sections, and demonstrate how it is necessary to meet course outcomes. For the benefit of students and colleagues across campus, this should be kept to a minimum, focusing only on the most necessary experiences. Course fees - Should be minimized, and if proposed, must meet fee guidelines. (See Course Fee Guideline document)</li>
            <li>For courses which have multiple sections, common Student-Learning Outcomes, Key assessments which indicate common outcome attainment, and general content must be the same. Teaching pedagogy can vary between sections and modes of delivery. Our curriculum management tool (CMT – or Kuali) will be the official repository of all Student-Learning Outcomes. Any changes to these Student-Learning Outcomes will need to go through the regular curriculum change process.</li>

            <li>Certificates will not be “officially” awarded unless at least 6 credits are completed with BYU-Idaho coursework</li>
            <li>Marketing must be careful to indicate that this is part of a degree and not a stand-alone option that students can choose. Students can add a certificate with elective credits, like they would add a minor</li>
            <li>Students cannot “declare” a certificate as their only path of study. They must declare an associate degree or a bachelor’s degree</li>

        <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
        <p>The following are principles to help guide curriculum decisions. The first set of principles came from a visit of the Executive Committee of the Board to BYU-Idaho in September 2017 and came from discussions had around curriculum. These have not been defined but should give us all the opportunity to ponder what we are doing and how we are going about it.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Responsive Curricula</li>
          <li>Set rules for simplification</li>
          <li>Stackable curricula</li>
          <li>Sequenced modularity</li>
          <li>Elegant simplicity balanced with flexibility and comprehensibility for students</li>
          <li>One of the constant questions we must ask ourselves: Should we be doing this (course, program, major)?</li>
          <li>Importance of pruning – letting in the light vs extensive coverage of content</li>
          <li>Importance of teaching practical skills</li>
          <li>Importance of teaching eternal knowledge</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Foundational Addresses</h2>
        <p>Following are principles of curricula that grew out of a review of foundational addresses as well as input from Curriculum Council and Academic Council. "All new curriculum proposals (new courses or programs) must show how they are meeting these 5 principles."3 </p>
        <button class="accordion">1. Mission alignment <span class='icon'>+</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><em>Every innovation, every change, will be measured against this test of the heart: “How would this proposed change build testimony and true conversion to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in the heart of a student?” Developing and deepening our devotion as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. In this school in Zion in Rexburg . . . disciples can follow the Savior and learn of and from Him the lessons that will prepare them for effective service in their home, in the Church, and in their communities and careers. (President Eyring, Elder Bednar)  </em></p>
          <p>Underlying everything we do should be a very deliberate focus on our mission. All curriculum decisions should consider this and seek to center changes on our mission. </p>
          <p>Consider the following questions as they relate to mission alignment.  </p>
          <ol>
            <li>How would this proposed change build testimony and true conversion to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in the heart of a student.</li>
            <li>Does the proposed change foster leadership experiences and opportunities for students to learn how to learn independently?</li>
            <li>Does the curriculum "weld together both temporal and spiritual things and make explicit connections between the two?" (Linford, item 2, 1) To this end, does the curriculum "follow the Learning Model principles, with the aim of preparing students for lives of service wherever they find themselves?" (Linford, item 12, 3) The learning model principles are listed below.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Exercise Faith</li>
              <li>Take Action</li>
              <li>Teach by the Spirit</li>
              <li>Love, Serve, and Teach</li>
              <li>Lay Hold on the Word of God </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Is program design and course curriculum responsive to the needs of first-year students? For example, curriculum of "entry-level courses should be designed to make it possible for all students to succeed rather than serve as barriers to unqualified students" (Linford, item 6 & 7, 1-2) </li>
            <li>Does the design facilitate access and success for all students? </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">2. Learning for life <span class='icon'>+</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><em>Natural leaders who know how to teach and how to learn. Educating the whole man and woman. Prepare them for effective service in their homes, in the Church, and in their communities and careers. Curricular innovations that are less bachelor centric, including certificates and applied associate degrees. (President Eyring, Elder Bednar, President Gilbert) </em></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Our curriculum should be learning centered, applied, and experiential. It should prepare graduates for their futures.  </li>
            <li>We should provide opportunities for our students to develop meta-cognitive learning skills that prepare them to continue to learn throughout their lives. </li>
            <li>Leadership is a central skill we want our students to develop and is closely tied to learning for life. Part of leadership is having the proper skills to be successful in navigating the ever-changing world we live in. </li>
            <li>Incorporate Institutional Learning Outcomes into programs to help students gain skills that are bigger than the discipline.  </li>
            <li>Most of our curriculum should be tailored to the student type that makes up most of our student body, while recognizing the need for some exceptions in a few specialized areas.  </li>
            <p>Consider the following questions as it relates to learning for life. </p>
            <li>Does the resulting curriculum educate the whole person: spiritually, intellectually, emotionally, and physically? </li>
            <li>Does the curriculum help a student to apply in real life situations what has been learned in the classroom? </li>
            <li>Does the curriculum support the Institutional Learning Outcomes? </li>
            <li>Does the change facilitate students having Impactful Leadership opportunities? </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">3. Outcome driven, and quality tested<span class='icon'>+</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><em>Create even more powerful and effective learning experiences in which students learn by faith. Learning and teaching processes at BYU-Idaho are focused and intense. We must develop more rigorous and holistic ways to measure and track student outcomes. Move forward rapidly even as we pause to thoroughly assess and evaluate our existing programs. (Elder Clark, Elder Bednar, President Gilbert) </em></p>
          <p>We need to transition from a traditional model of students simply jumping through hoops to graduate, toward a holistic model where students see how all the parts are connected and help them become. By developing intentional student learning outcomes and then finding ways to measure those outcomes, we can transform our education and bless students in many ways. Ideally, our programs will be based on learning outcomes and not simply a collection of courses. Everything we do should be improvement minded. We should seek to improve the quality of our programs, the learning of our students, and the success of our graduates. Effective assessment that is monitored will lead to quality improvements. Additionally, learning outcomes should be transparent to students. They should know what they are learning and how they can articulate that learning to potential employers. </p>
          <p>
            Consider the following questions as they relate to outcome driven and quality tested:  
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Are students achieving the Institutional, Program, and Course Outcomes? </li>
            <li>Does the proposed change allow students to expand their ability to act? </li>
            <li>Are the learning outcomes central to the design of the course or program? </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">4. Simple and flexible<span class='icon'>+</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><em>Rethink and reevaluate many of our most fundamental assumptions about the processes of learning and teaching. Facilitate the integration of curriculum and pedagogy across traditional boundaries. Success will be determined by what a department or a major does to strengthen other departments and other majors across campus. We must begin with both the end and the beginning in mind. Frugal design, flexibility to change majors without incurring a graduation delay. Nesting of certificate and associate degree within the bachelor’s program. (Elder Bednar, President Gilbert, President Henry J. Eyring) </em></p>
          <p>Because students are likely to work in multiple career types across their lifetime, we need to think holistically and creatively to create programs that integrate broad life-skills into the curriculum and create multi-disciplinary experiences where that makes sense. These programs need to be modular and stackable or nested with multiple entry and exit points while being clear and understandable for students to navigate. Where possible, students should be given marketable skills early, by focusing on application rather than just theory. We need to constantly think about what we are doing to integrate with and strengthen other areas of campus rather than focusing exclusively on our own area. Our efforts should provide students with ease of entry into a major and build relationships between students and faculty.  </p>
          <p>Consider the following questions as they relate to simple and flexible curriculum. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Is the curriculum is responsive to the needs of "every day students." (Linford, item 5, 1)  </li>
            <li>Are programs stackable so that mid-program career launching points are available? (Linford, item 10, 3) </li>
            <li>Does the proposed change promote curriculum that is modular and flexible? </li>
            <li>Are there transferable or soft skills that can be woven naturally into the course or program? </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">5. Frugality and focus<span class='icon'>+</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><em>The school will need to change and even eliminate some long-standing and beneficial programs as the school focuses on key academic disciplines. Focus, not growth and spread, in academic offerings. Thoroughly assess and evaluate our existing programs. Better stewards of sacred resources. Higher quality experience while requiring relatively fewer resources per student. Faculty sacrifice what they do best and love most for what the Lord wants even more for our students.  (President Hinckley, President Eyring, Elder Bednar, Elder Clark) </em></p>
          <p>We should focus our efforts on ways that best use resources to bless all students who choose to attend here. We should avoid unnecessary duplication of courses or programs across campus. Our programs should be as lean as possible in number of credits and in courses required. Innovation will be critical to doing this well. Resource stewardship also involves providing a clear path for students as they move through a program, so they do not have to spend more time than is necessary in obtaining in-house certificates or degrees. It also involves the effective use of physical space, faculty load, oversight by Department Chairs, and financial cost to the University and to students. An understanding of equipment and material cost/benefits is also central to this process. Our example of being frugal with resources and striving to do more with less will bless students as they apply that same pattern in their lives. </p>
          <p>Consider the following questions as they relate to frugality and focus. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Does the proposed change cause the curriculum to spread, or become more focused? Is this an expansion of courses or programs? If it is, are there other areas where we can reduce?</li>
            <li>Does curriculum "have as its first priority preparing students for the workplace? (Linford, item 11, 3)</li>
            <li>Does the curriculum provide a top quality education at a low cost? (Linford, item 4, 1)</li>
            <li>Do programs deliver the necessary outcomes without imposing high credit demands? (Linford, item 8 & 9, 2)</li>
            <li>What is the primary focus (employable opportunities, graduate school preparation, professional school, etc.)?</li>
            <li>Does the proposed change allow the department to serve more students within existing resources?</li>

      <h2>Standards</h2>
      <p>The following standards will be the criteria by which all curricular changes will be evaluated.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Alignment with Guiding Principles – Justification information should reflect this alignment.
        </li>
        <li>Student-Learning Outcome centric design of courses and programs – The syllabus or program justification must show how the student-learning outcomes are central and are incorporated into the course or program design. These student-learning outcomes should include both content and life-skills and should be mapped to the program student-learning outcomes.  </li>
        <li>Key assessments tied to each student-learning outcome – Each student-learning outcome should have a way of indicating how well it is being met. These assessments need to be sustainable and specific enough for improvements to be made in a periodic cycle. A well vetted map (course or program) must be included to show what assessments are being used to show outcome attainment at the course level and how all the courses fit together to achieve outcomes at the program level.</li>
        <li>BYU-Idaho Learning Outcomes (ILOs) – These are outcomes we expect of all students who graduate from BYU-Idaho. They are measured at two levels – Within General Education and within each academic program. All the ILOs will be assessed in addition to the PLOs. Common rubrics for assessing the ILOs.  The hope is that many, if not all courses will help students develop these skills and make that development visible to the students.</li>
        <p>Program specific standards</p>
        <li>Modular program design – Nesting or stacking of curriculum elements in ways that show deliberate design to bless the lives of all students.</li>
        <li>Collaboration - All courses included in a program proposal outside the sponsoring department need to show that the other department has been contacted and agrees with the class being included in or removed from the program.</li>
        <li>Certificate - Proposals must fit the following criteria:
          <ol>
            <li>Builds toward an employer identified skill set that will give students an advantage in the job market.</li>
            <li>Has well defined outcomes and assessments that have been vetted and mapped and measure job skill development that is the focus of the certificate.</li>
            <li>Must be between 12-15 credits. No option can take a student below 12 credits or above 15 credits.</li>
            <li>Should be a specific set of classes with no or very limited optional classes.</li>
            <li>If it is designated as an advanced certificate, the prerequisites must be included in the program of study.</li>
            <li>Must be fully nested in an associate degree or bachelor’s degree. This means that the certificate cannot have options that are not in the degree and the degree cannot have options that are not in the certificate.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <p>Additional certificate considerations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Certificates will be evaluated during regular program reviews to determine if they are still meeting the established criteria and outcomes are being measured and met.</li>
          <li>Use other terms (module, cluster) to distinguish parts of a degree that do not fit the definition of a certificate.</li>
          <li>Certificates will not be “officially” awarded unless at least 6 credits are completed with BYU-Idaho coursework.</li>
          <li>Students can add a certificate with elective credits, like they would add a minor, if the certificate is outside their major.</li>
          <li>Students cannot “declare” a certificate as their only path of study and be eligible for federal financial aid.</li>
          <li>Subject to approval by Curriculum Council, Deans Council, President’s Council, the board, and NWCCU.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cluster – 12-15 credits, mostly used as an advisory tool, not recognized by the NWCCU, approvals with UCC, No diploma, No PLOs, No Program Review.</li>
        <li>Concentration – 27-33 credits, Group of courses with a concentrated focus within a discipline, linked to the IDS degree program, not recognized by the NWCCU, Approvals with UCC and DC, No diploma, No PLOs, No Program Review.</li>
        <li>Cluster – 12-15 credits, mostly used as an advisory tool, not recognized by the NWCCU, approvals with UCC, No diploma, No PLOs, No Program Review.</li>
        <li>Concentration – 27-33 credits, Group of courses with a concentrated focus within a discipline, linked to the IDS degree program, not recognized by the NWCCU, Approvals with UCC and DC, No diploma, No PLOs, No Program Review.</li>
        <li>Minor – 18-25 credits, group of courses to give students a broad understanding across a discipline, recognized but not reported to NWCCU yet, Approvals with UCC, PEG, CES, and the Board, No diploma, does show on the transcript, PLOs not required yet, No Program Review yet.</li>
        <li>Emphasis area – Intended to provide minor additional focus to an existing degree. Should be a small subset of the program (preferably 9-15 credits).  We have been asked to limit these.</li>
        <li>Standard bachelor’s degree – 40-55 credits.   </li>
        <li>Integrated standard degree – 56-67 credits, which is a standard degree plus 12-15 credits from another area. Limited to those who show a strong need for a particular combination of areas.  </li>
        <li>Specialized degree – Limited to those with external accreditation requirements that are mandatory.</li>
        <li>Education degrees – These have very strict rules but do not fit any of the above categories exactly.</li>
        <p>Course specific standards</p>
        <li>No net new courses – If new courses are proposed, a plan for meeting the needs of those new courses within existing resources must be provided. Our hope is at least a 1:1 ratio of new courses with courses being discontinued.</li>
        <li>Eliminate duplication of courses across departments – Departments work together to best meet the needs of students with the goal of minimizing or eliminating duplication.</li>
        <li>Follow contact hour guidelines – These are based on Department of Education definitions including credit hours awarded and type of contact – 1 credit of “lecture” allows 1 instructor/student contact hour per week. 1 credit of “lab or guided instruction” allows 1-3 instructor/student contact hours per week. Total student workload, including contact hours, should be around 3 hours per week per credit for all courses.</li>
        <li>Required course travel – If travel for a course requires students to spend time outside of regularly scheduled class times, it must be in the syllabus, be required of all sections, and demonstrate how it is necessary to meet course outcomes. For the benefit of students and colleagues across campus, this should be kept to a minimum, focusing only on the most necessary experiences.</li>
        <li>Course fees – Should be minimized and must meet fee guidelines.</li>
        <li>For courses which have multiple sections, common Student-Learning Outcomes, and Key assessments, which indicate common outcome attainment, must be the same. Teaching pedagogy can vary between sections and modes of delivery. Our curriculum management tool (CMT) will be the official repository of all common Student-Learning Outcomes. Any changes to these common Student-Learning Outcomes will need to go through the regular curriculum change process.</li>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>"Departments will be responsible to make sure all proposals have complete documentation and rationale and show appropriate fit for the department. They can do this with a curriculum committee if they choose, but the department process will be left to the discretion of the Department Chair (Department Chairs give approval in our CMT)."1 </p>
      <h3>Step 1 - Course Changes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In winter (year 1) you will submit changes to courses.  </li>
        <li>Changes to a course might include things like: 1. a change in the description, 2. credit hours, 3. prerequisites, or 4. course learning outcomes.  </li>
        <li>A change to credit hours and contact hours impact each program within which the course resides and it impacts FLUs. You will need to do an evaluation of FLUs if you change credit or contact hours.  </li>
        <li>Rule of thumb 1: you will not be allowed to change the content of a course, or its outcomes, more than about 30%. A change of more than 30% requires that the course be deleted and a new course created.  </li>
        <li>Rule of thumb 2: you will not be allowed to add a course unless you delete a course (net-zero).  </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Step 2 - Program Changes </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In Spring (year 1) you will submit changes to programs.  </li>
        <li>Changes to a program might include things like a change to the course credit hours because a course in the program was canceled or added.  </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Step 3 - Changes are reviewed by University </h3>
      <p>During Spring (yr 1), Fall (yr 1), and Winter (yr 2), the changes move from the Curriculum Council to a University Academic Council and to various departments for review. After approval, changes are input into the catalog system.  </p>
      <p>"Once approved at the department level, curriculum will be vetted at the college level. Each college will create a college curriculum council that will be responsible to review all proposals within its college. This council will look at need, fit, relevance, resource requests, and adherence to all curriculum guidelines. Most curriculum proposals will be approved at this level with guidance from the Curriculum Executive Council to ensure consistency across the University and compatibility with current systems. When a proposal requires additional review, the Associate Dean requests a full University Curriculum Council review (Associate Dean for Curriculum gives approval in our CMT)."1 </p>
      <p>"New programs, IDS changes, General Education changes, fee changes, and increased resource requests may require additional approval at the Deans Council, President’s Council, Board of Trustees, and NWCCU level before any implementation can take place."1 </p>
      <p>There are multiple software products that work together and some that do not work well with one another.  </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The catalog is built from Kuali.  </li>
        <li>Information in the catalog (via Kuali) must be hand-entered into CX (Jenzebar) and then from there filters into the grad planner, degree audit, registration, and graduation. Human errors happen so work patiently with those who are entering changes. It is quite a process because there is no API between CX and Kuali. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Step 4 - Changes are approved and published </h3>
      <p>Changes are published in the Spring Catalog (yr 2) that is used by students to sign up for Spring courses (yr 2).  </p>

      <h2>Questions to Consider</h2>
      <p>As a department or program considers changes to a course or program, please consider the following questions. Changes will not necessarily meet all the principles these questions raise, but they can provide context for making good, mission-aligned curricular decisions.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How would this proposed change build testimony and true conversion to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in the heart of a student?</li>
        <li>Does the proposed change foster leadership experiences and opportunities for students to learn how to learn independently?</li>
        <li>Does the resulting curriculum educate the whole person: spiritually, intellectually, emotionally, and physically?</li>
        <li>Does the proposed change cause the curriculum to spread, or become more focused? Is this an expansion of courses or programs? If it is, are there other areas where we can reduce?</li>
        <li>Does the proposed change allow students to expand their ability to act?</li>
        <li>Does the design facilitate access and success for all students?</li>
        <li>What is the primary focus (employable opportunities, graduate school preparation, professional school, etc.)?</li>
        <li>Does the proposed change promote curriculum that is modular and flexible?</li>
        <li>Does the proposed change allow the department to serve more students within existing resources?</li>
        <li>Does the proposed change strengthen other departments and programs across campus?</li>
        <li>Are the learning outcomes central to the design of the course or program?</li>
        <li>Are there transferable or soft skills that can be woven naturally into the course or program?</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Timing - The Curriculum Consequence Cat and His Long Tail</h2>
      <p>If your changes are wrong or ill advised, you and your students will live with it for a long time. </p>
      <p>Changing the curriculum is quite a long and involved process. Most important for you to remember is that a change made today does not impact students until about one year after you made the change, but once the change has been implemented it has ramifications for many semesters. The following image attempts to visually display how long a change remains on the system. Changing a course or a program starts in the first year (first row) and is not approved until the sixth semester after the change was started. If the change does not accomplish what you intended, students will live with the change for at least five to six semesters before the change can be reversed. Once reversed, the change will reside in the older catalogs for seven years. As shown below, a change to curriculum in a catalog year is available to students who are linked to that catalog year for about ten years.  </p>
