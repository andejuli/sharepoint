                <li>Your pattern of review and discussion, including the quality of data collected and reviewed. Meeting minutes can be useful evidence of the committee’s process.  </li>

                    <ul>

            <p><span>Activities:</span></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Seek the Spirit’s help in seeing around the corners: what themes have industry been sharing with you, what is changing in your industry, have you had any feelings about what the future of your industry may demand, what do your students say about how your program has helped them be prepared to meet the changes in industry, etc.</li>
                <li>Develop forward-looking strategies for curriculum, content, and assessment enhancements. </li>
